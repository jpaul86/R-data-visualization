## Introduction

>The European energy market has a framework of rules set to equalize taxes and levies for household energy prices. These taxes and levies are often accounted for to drive or lower energy prices when moving across borders, but is this really true, especially if we are considering the European energy market being more and more able to trade and send energy across borders?  

>Many of the factors in energy generation, the complexity of the power grid, its support by new investments shouldered by the consumer, and the penalties for externalized costs through carbon emissions and waste storage all serve to equalize prices and make them "fair" and true to their origin.  

>As we are looking at full official datasets from 2021 and the years before, we will not be looking at the highly volatile supply vs demand scenarios happening in 2022. So these do not have an effect yet.  
Our goal is to find out about correlations within the datasets provided by Eurostats and present them graphically in an aesthetic and expressive way.  

*Disclaimer: This project example is not claiming scientific truth, but focuses on how to get, explore, wrangle and visualize.*

## The price of electricity

>This looks expensive for German households at the first glance. At the end of 2021 the price per kWh is almost reaching 35c. It is often suggested that the high energy prices in Germany have only been a recent problem. However here we can see that these have already been high since 2017!  

>It is fairly obvious that France has the most competitive prices with a fairly stable but slow rise towards higher prices as well.
High volatility can be seen in Spain, with the largest difference between winter of 2017 at roughly 22c to winter of 2021 at 28c.

## Green energy - a price driver?
>While we are hunting for the reasons of price pushes, we think of the notions often put forward by the opponents of green energy:   
There are many fake arguments against renewables like wind and solar or other forms of green energy like modern nuclear power. There are efficient consumer forms of energy like electric cars and modern heat pumps as well which are having a hard time with many fake arguments getting religiously repeated.  

>In order to see if the critics are right with the notion that green energy is more expensive than other forms of energy, let us check out if there are dependencies by looking at the EU in total and the 4 largest countries in the year 2021.

>So we can safely assume that the end price does not solely depend on how much of the energy mix of a country is carbon neutral either!
It is interesting to see that Germany is having a worse energy mix than the actual **average** of the European Union - while being much more expensive!  
Also, Poland and the Netherlands have a very questionable energy mix.  

*We mentioned the worse energy mix. We may be on to something!*

## The mix matters! 

>We have seen that the share of greens in the energy mix does not seem to matter much. Is there anything else in the energy mix that might correlate with higher prices? Let's take a look at the complexity, spread and heterogeneousity of the energy mixes of our countries. We add Poland to it as it is sufficiently sized and has been such a cheap outlier before, indicating that it might help towards finding out what may drive price!

>What we see immediately here is that the further we go up in price, the more heterogeneous and complex the sources of energy production are. Germany and Spain have a very spread energy mix from over 6 to 7 different sources, and they also top the prices. 
Italy's distribution is already softer, focusing evenly around 4 sources.

>We have already established that it does not seem to matter much towards price whether the energy mix is green or not. With France and Poland we can see low prices, and them focusing on 2 sources mainly:  
1. France with its focus on nuclear power can bring some competitive prices to the consumer market at 19.8c/kWh while being very close to carbon neutrality in this sector.  
2. Poland with its focus on Coal and (natural) gas making up almost 90% of the country's energy generation offers very competitive prices at 15.6c/kWh.  

>Comparing the heterogeneous but expensive generation to a more homogeneous and affordable energy generation of some of the largest European states, **we can thus conclude that the distribution of the mix may indeed matter** - and that heterogeneous energy generation may be a driver for higher prices!
